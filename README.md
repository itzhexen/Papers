# Resolution-Based Informational Ontology

**Author:** itzhexen  
**Date:** June 2025

This repository explores a framework where reality is understood as informational flow through structures that resolve uncertainty. Observation, identity, time, and events arise from the process of resolutionâ€”where information collapses into defined form.

This ontology removes reliance on consciousness or measurement, treating all systems as observers in terms of informational boundaries and collapse. It serves as a conceptual and analytical tool for examining complex systems.

The work is ongoing and experimental, intended to provide a new lens for understanding information, structure, and the emergence of meaning.
